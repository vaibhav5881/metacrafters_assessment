## Token Contract
This is a Solidity contract for a custom ERC20 token called "Vaibhav" with the symbol "VBV". The contract extends the ERC20 and Ownable contracts from the OpenZeppelin library.

## Features
The Token contract provides the following features:

- Minting: The owner of the contract can mint new tokens and assign them to a specific address.
- Transfer: Token holders can transfer tokens to other addresses.
- Burning: Token holders can burn their own tokens to reduce the total supply.

## Usage
To use this contract, you can follow these steps:

Deploy the contract on a compatible Ethereum network (e.g., Rinkeby, Ropsten, or a local development network).
After deployment, the contract owner can call the mint function to create and assign tokens to specific addresses.
Token holders can transfer their tokens to other addresses using the transfer function.
Token holders can burn their tokens by calling the burn function.
